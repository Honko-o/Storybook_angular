2.  **`node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages).

3.  **`src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on your application.

4.  **`.editorconfig`**: This file contains the configurations for [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).

5.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track or maintain during the development process of your project.

<h2>Definitions:</h2>
1. <b>Pure Component</b>: a Component that handle the props it recieve only example(pure-task-list.ts).<br/>
2. <b>Interactions</b>: a Way to simulate real actions that user will make on the UI (click, hover, etc...).<br/>
3. <b>Addons</b>: a tool that can enhance the developer experience (controls, actions, interactions testing, accessbility testing).

<br />

<h2>Storybook Path Configuration:</h2>
<p>go to <b>directory .storybook/main.ts</b> to configure the path for including <b>stories and addons</b></p>

<h2>Container Elements Example and Nesting</h2>
<p>We can not use <b>pure-inbox-screen component</b> in the storybook<br/>
because it contains <b>task-list component</b> which needs data from the (ngxs store/NgRx store) <br />
in this case we supply the store in the <b>pure-inbox-screen.stories.ts with:
<code>
<pre>
applicationConfig({
      providers: [Store, importProvidersFrom(NgxsModule.forRoot([TasksState]))],
})
</pre>
</code>
<br/>
and we need to supply the modules it use with:
<code>
<pre>
moduleMetadata({
      imports: [CommonModule, TaskModule],
})
</pre>
</code>
The Above will make the screen live and make it work like working in the real application
</br></p>
